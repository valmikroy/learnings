# Financial Ratio

This section contents standard ratios derived from financial statement and their significance.

### Return on Assets

Return on assets (ROA) is an indicator of how well a company utilizes its assets in terms of profitability.

```
Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets
```

ROA is best used when comparing similar companies or by comparing a company to its own previous performance.



ROA does not take into account a company’s debt, while return on equity (ROE) does—if a company carries no debt, its shareholders' equity and its total assets will be the same and ROA would equal ROE.

```
Return on Equity = Net Income / Average shareholders' equity 
```



Compare ROE and ROA to understand the proportion of the debt.



### Return on Invested Capital

This ratio suggest amount of money a company makes that is above the average cost it pays for its debt and equity capital.

In other words, if ROIC is more than WACC is a sign of company creating value. 

```
ROIC = Net operating profit after tax / Invested Capital
```

ROIC is always calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as an annualized or trailing 12-month value.

### Current ratio

```
Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities
```

The current ratio helps investors understand more about a company’s ability to cover its short-term debt with its current assets and make apples-to-apples comparisons with its competitors and peers. Current ratio more than 1 suggests that company's short team liabilities can be easily covered.

### Quick ratio

This is realistic version of current ratio which takes realisitc liquidable assets instead of just current assets to measure companies ability to pay off short term debts.

 ```
Quick ratio = ( Cash & Equivalents + Marketable securities + Account recievable ) / Current liabilities

or

Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses ) / Current liabilities 
 ```
