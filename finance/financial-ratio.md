# Financial Ratio

This section contents standard ratios derived from financial statement and their significance.



### EBITDA Margin

- Net income was calculated after deducting series of deduction from revenue
   - Revenue - Operating expenese = Operating income
   - Operating income - non-Operating expenses = Income before taxes
   - Income before taxes - taxes = Net Income
- EBITDA = Earning before Interest, Taxes, Dividend and Amortization. This is calculated by adding back interest payment, taxes, dividend and amortization into net income. 

This ratio is `EBITDA/Revenue`

This shows companies ability to generate cashflow.



### Net Profit Margin

This is ratio of `Net income/Revenue`.

This is left over amount after everything stripped out of the revenue.



### Operating Margin

Operating income is what left after subtracting operating expenses from the revneue. This removes effect of taxes and non-operating expenses while calculating ratio against the revenue. 

`Operating income/Revenue`




### Return on Assets

Return on assets (ROA) is an indicator of how well a company utilizes its assets in terms of profitability.

```
Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets
```

ROA is best used when comparing similar companies or by comparing a company to its own previous performance.



ROA does not take into account a company’s debt, while return on equity (ROE) does—if a company carries no debt, its shareholders' equity and its total assets will be the same and ROA would equal ROE.

```
Return on Equity = Net Income / Average shareholders' equity 
```



Compare ROE and ROA to understand the proportion of the debt.



### Return on Invested Capital

This ratio suggest amount of money a company makes that is above the average cost it pays for its debt and equity capital.

In other words, if ROIC is more than WACC is a sign of company creating value. 

```
ROIC = Net operating profit after tax / Invested Capital
```

ROIC is always calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as an annualized or trailing 12-month value.

### Current ratio

```
Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities
```

The current ratio helps investors understand more about a company’s ability to cover its short-term debt with its current assets and make apples-to-apples comparisons with its competitors and peers. 

Current ratio more than 1 suggests that company's short team liabilities can be easily covered.

### Quick ratio

This is realistic version of current ratio which takes realisitc liquidable assets instead of just current assets to measure companies ability to pay off short term debts.

 ```
Quick ratio = ( Cash & Equivalents + Marketable securities + Account recievable ) / Current liabilities

or

Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses ) / Current liabilities 
 ```



### Debt to equity ratio

From balance sheet you can gather a formula 

`Assets =  Liabilities + Equity`

Debt is a part of `Liabilities`.

`Equity = Assets - Liabilities`

So we can calculate this ration 

```
D/E = Debt / ( Assets - Liabilities )
```

If you have far less assets compared to your liabilities then you can get this ratio into negative.



Then you can look at Quick or Current ratio to see if short term assets can cover short term liabilities. 

 

### Net Debt / EBITDA

This ratio will suggest how much more money company will need to pay of its debt compare to its EBITDA.
