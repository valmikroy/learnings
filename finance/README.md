## Income statement

- Revenue - Amount of money company made during reporting period.

- Expenses - Amount of money company spends during reporting period.

- Cost of goods sold (COGS) - Cost of component parts and materials it takes to make whatever it is a business sells.

- Gross profit = Revenue  - COGS 

- Operating expenses (OPEX)

  - An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations. 

  - Often abbreviated as OPEX, operating expenses include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance, step costs, and funds allocated for research and development.

  - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows businesses to deduct operating expenses if the business operates to earn profits.

  - By contrast, a non-operating expense is an expense incurred by a business that is unrelated to the business's core operations.

  - Income statements typically categorize expenses into six groups: 

    - cost of goods sold; 

    - [selling, general, and administrative costs](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-operating-expenses-and-sga.asp); 

    - depreciation and amortization; 

    - other [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overhead-ratio.asp); 

    - interest expenses; 

    - and income taxes. 

      **All these expenses can be considered operating expenses**, 

     

  - but when determining **operating income** using an income statement, interest expenses and income taxes are excluded.

- Capital expenditure CAPEX
  capital expenses are purchases that a business makes as an investment, Capital expenditures include costs related to acquiring or upgrading tangible and intangible assets.

  - Tangible business assets include real estate, factory equipment, computers, office furniture, and other physical capital assets. 
  - Intangible assets include intellectual property, copyrights, patents, trademarks, et. al.

- The IRS treats capital expenses differently than operating expenses. According to the IRS, operating expenses must be ordinary (common and accepted in the business trade) and necessary (helpful and appropriate in the business trade). In general, businesses are allowed to write off operating expenses for the year in which the expenses were incurred; alternatively, businesses must **capitalize** capital expenses/costs. (applicable for dpreciation) 

- Non-Operating Expense - A non-operating expense is a cost that is unrelated to the business's core operations. The most common types of non-operating expenses are interest charges or other costs of borrowing, payments to settle lawsuits, restructuring costs and losses on the disposal of assets. Accountants sometimes remove non-operating expenses to examine the performance of the business, ignoring the effects of financing and other irrelevant issues. 

- Operating income = Gross profit - Expenses 

- Income before taxes = Operating income - non-operating expenses

- Net income  = Income before taxes - taxes.

- EBITDA :  Ability to generate cash flow, calculate by adding net profit, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 





## Cashflow statement&#x20;

Cash flow statements are broken into three sections: cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from investing activities, and cash flow from financing activities.

• **Operating activities** detail cash flow that’s generated once the company delivers its regular goods or services and includes both revenue and expenses.

• **Investing activities** comprise of cash flow from purchasing or selling assets using free cash, **not debt**; this is usually in the form of physical property, such as real estate or vehicles, and non-physical property, like patents.

• **Financing activities** detail cash flow from both debt and equity financing
